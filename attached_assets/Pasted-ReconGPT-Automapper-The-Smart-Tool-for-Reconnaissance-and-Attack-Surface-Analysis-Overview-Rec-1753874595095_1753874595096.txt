ReconGPT Automapper – The Smart Tool for Reconnaissance and Attack Surface Analysis
📌 Overview:
ReconGPT Automapper is an advanced tool that combines traditional reconnaissance techniques with artificial intelligence to create an intelligent picture of a target’s infrastructure and identify the most vulnerable attack points.

🎯 What does the tool do?
It aggregates data from well-known recon tools such as:

amass – for discovering subdomains.

subfinder – for additional subdomain enumeration.

httpx – for scanning open protocols and ports.

nuclei – for surface vulnerability analysis.

Then, it analyzes the results using GPT to:

Classify domains by importance and risk level.

Detect suspicious patterns (e.g., dev, staging, admin, test).

Provide target prioritization.

It also draws an interactive map of relationships between targets:

Who is connected to whom?

Which domain controls another?

What are the key touchpoints?

How can this link with results from tools like JSFlow AI?

🧠 AI Capabilities inside the tool:
Function	Practical Example
Target classification	"This domain runs on Port 8080, without HTTPS → High risk."
Pattern detection	"The word 'internal' in internal.api.example.com indicates an internal environment → Test SSRF."
Relationship analysis	"login.example.com uses SSO linked to api.example.com ← Try Auth Bypass."
Complementary tools	"Run JSFlow AI on these domains to extract more API endpoints from JavaScript."

🧾 Outputs:
Visual map showing domain structure, services, protocols, and critical points.

AI-generated intelligence report with smart recommendations.

JSON and HTML outputs for integration or documentation.

🛠️ Tool Features:
Feature	Benefit
Support for popular Recon tools	Works directly with established tools—no reinvention needed.
Automated smart analysis	Saves time on manual thinking and analysis.
Attack surface mapping	Builds a clear visual understanding of the potential attack paths.
Guided reports	Tells you what to do next and where to start.

🔗 Ideal Use Case:
You target target.com.
You run ReconGPT Automapper:

bash
نسخ
تحرير
python recongpt.py --domain target.com
You get:

100+ subdomains.

A prioritized attack list.

A smart interactive map.

AI-driven offensive recommendations.

Note:
There is no need to include a web interface for this tool. Keeping it CLI-based is sufficient and preferred for professional use, avoiding unnecessary complexity and security risks.
